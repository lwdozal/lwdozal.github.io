### Network Analysis - Street Art
In this analysis, Street Art images are considered as a type of visual information that can represent a specific perception of a community as a member of a community space. While understanding community attributes through perceptual tools we can use social network analysis methodology to understand how different neighborhoods are connected and how they might differ. The results show that specific neighborhood traits, urban, population, culture contribute to stronger ties within the Street Art community network.

### Natural Language Processing - Machine Learning 
This project two natural language processing models on a dataset composed of labeled propaganda data. We reviewed off the shelf BERT and the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) models and found they both provide different accuracy levels, with BERT maintaining better results for the binary data classification problem.

### Dissertation Research


## Data Science: Private Datasets and Code

### Sentiment Analysis: Student Course Survey Comments

I analyzed 30K+ student course surveys using sentiment analysis packages in R to identify sentiment for all comments provided in student course surveys across campus. I also used SQL to pull the data from the Oracle database to be used for a personalized instructor dashboard.

### Survival Analysis: University Retention and Attrition

I used survival and churn analysis to analyze the expected duration of attrition for female students and The University of Arizona. Here, Kaplan Mier and the supporting cox regression analysis were used to study retention. Churn analysis including methods of logistic regression, decision trees and random forests were used to study attrition.

### Internal Dashboard: Net Tuition Revenue

I developed an end-to-end production process of tuition and headcount dashboard visualizations and analysis using R and SQL. This consisted of aggregated data tables from an internal Oracle data warehouse that include descriptive statistics and inflation information of campus-wide Net Tuition Revenue (NTR).

### Campus Climate Survey: Statistical Analysis and Inference

Applied statistical analysis and inference to surveys and collected data to review and test the University of Arizona’s Medical School’s performance for future accreditation. Types of data included survey data, raw archived data, collected government and academic data from large data systems. Used both R and Python to use analysis of variance, chi-square tests, post hoc and assumptions checks, regression analysis, correlation analysis, visualizations.
